        <h1> üëã Hi, I'm Toon.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a technologist living in Amsterdam with a passion for startups
          and a healthy fascination for what makes people tick. In the past,
          I've been an infrastructure engineer, web developer, product manager,
          technical sales engineer and agile product owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think that this background allows me to explore the world
          from many different perspectives which has turned me into a
          <b>tech generalist</b>. Tech is endlessly fascinating for me, mainly
          because there are endless things to learn.</p>
        <p>
          With a knack for explaining complex technical things and because I
          understand both the <b>software development</b> lifecycle as well as
          the <b>product development</b> lifecycle, I believe that I can help
          out in <b>creating new projects</b> or getting <b>existing ones to a
          whole new level</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>‚òïÔ∏è Want to have a chat?</h2>
        <p>
          Most importantly though, I'm always up for coffee. So, if you have a
          great idea but <b>don't know where to start</b>, or if you're looking
          for ways to increase your <b>Daily Active Users</b>, I'd love to sit
          down with you ‚úåÔ∏è
